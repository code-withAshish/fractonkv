## 📄 Documentation

Currently, documentation is **minimal** beyond inline code comments.  
We’ve started adding files that explain the **project’s goals** and **core architecture** to help newcomers get started.

📂 You can find them in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory. While still growing, these resources should give you a solid
starting point.

Planned improvements to documentation include:

- 📐 Expanding the **architecture overview** with detailed diagrams
- 📝 Adding a **Contributor’s Guide** with coding standards and workflows
- 🚀 Writing a **Quick Start Guide** with examples for running the project locally

📢 **Contributions to documentation are highly encouraged!**  
Even small improvements like clarifying comments, adding examples, or setup notes can make onboarding smoother.
